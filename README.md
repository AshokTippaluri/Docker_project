# What is docker?
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

• Docker enables to separate the applications from infrastructure so that software delivery is quick.

• Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.

• The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host.

# Docker Architecture
Docker uses a client-server architecture.

• The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can
connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.

• The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, which lets you work with applications consisting of containers.
